Data wrangling, which consists of:
     o Gathering data 
            ▪ Download any preferred datasets from UCI repository or Kaggle.
     o Assessing data.
            ▪ After gathering your data, assess them visually and programmatically for quality 
              and tidiness issues. Detect and document at least eight (8) quality issues and 
              two (2) tidiness issues.
     o Cleaning data.
            ▪ Clean each of the issues you documented while assessing.
• Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
     o Store the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file. If additional files exist because multiple tables 
     are required for tidiness, name these files appropriately.
     o Use matplotlib and seaborn packages for visualizing.
• Apply any classification/clustering algorithm on your data and visualize your results
     o Hint: use scikit-learn Python package for classifying or clustering: https://scikitlearn.org/stable/
• Reporting on 1) your data wrangling efforts and 2) your data analyses and visualizations
     o Create a 300-600 word written report called wrangle_report.pdf that briefly describes 
       your wrangling efforts (i.e., define and describe briefly at least eight (8) quality issues
       and two (2) tidiness issues).
     o Create a 250-word-minimum written report called act_report.pdf that communicates 
       the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from your wrangled data (i.e., put 
       graphs plotted by matplotlib package and describe them briefly).
     o Create a 100-word-minimum written report called prediction_results.pdf that briefly 
       describes the used classification/clustering algorithm and concludes the output
